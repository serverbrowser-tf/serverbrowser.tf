# Changelog

## 2025-05-01

* Added max player count filter
* Added github advertisement in console
* Added way for admins to remove categories from servers


## 2025-04-27

* Modified `server_players` to got more accurate data on what maps are being played (currently unused)
* Modified wait time between querying servers from 2.5 minutes to 30 seconds

  This shouldn't effect analytics that much. It should just make the player
  count and the map more accurate when viewing the browser
